Welcome to the **Elite Web Development Journey**, a Coder Army Hackathon Champion project\! This is a multi-page educational website built with **100% pure HTML**, designed to prove that creativity isn't limited by technology. It embraces the aesthetic of the early web and hacker terminals, using only HTML tags and their attributes for structure, styling, and animation.

## ✨ Project Description

This project is a nostalgic trip back to the roots of the web, demonstrating a wide range of HTML concepts from the absolute basics to more complex structures like forms and tables. The entire website, including its "Matrix-like" theme, colors, animations (`<marquee>`, `<blink>`), and layout, is achieved without a single line of CSS or JavaScript.

The site is structured as a series of "Missions," where each mission corresponds to a lecture on a specific HTML topic, making it a gamified learning path for aspiring web developers.

## 🌟 Key Features

  * **Pure HTML Implementation:** All styling, layout, and effects are done using HTML attributes like `bgcolor`, `color`, `size`, `<font>`, `<center>`, and tables for structure.
  * **Retro Hacker Theme:** Features ASCII art, a dark terminal-style color palette, and classic animations to create an immersive, old-school vibe.
  * **Multi-Page Architecture:** A central "Mission Control" hub (`index.html`) navigates to five distinct lecture pages, each covering a core web development topic.
  * **Gamified Learning:** The content is presented as a series of missions with progress trackers, skill meters, and XP points to engage the learner.
  * **Comprehensive HTML Coverage:** The project serves as a practical demonstration of:
      * Basic Tags (`h1`-`h6`, `p`, `img`, `a`)
      * Lists (Ordered, Unordered, Nested)
      * Advanced Tables (`colspan`, `rowspan`, `thead`, `tbody`)
      * File Paths & Project Structure
      * Interactive Forms (`input`, `radio`, `checkbox`, `textarea`)
      * Multimedia (`audio`, `video`, `iframe`)

-----

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project proudly uses **only HTML**. The styling is handled by deprecated but functional attributes to meet the challenge constraints.

  * **Structure:** Semantic HTML5 tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`, `section`, `details`).
  * **Layout:** `<table>`, `<center>`, `align`.
  * **Styling:** `<font>`, `bgcolor`, `text`, `link`, `bordercolor`.
  * **Animation:** `<marquee>`, `<blink>`.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives Covered

Each page or "Mission" is designed to teach specific HTML concepts:

  * **Mission Alpha (`lecture1.html`):** Covers the foundational building blocks of the web, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and hyperlinks.
  * **Mission Beta (`lecture2.html`):** Dives into data organization with complex nested lists and powerful table structures using `colspan` and `rowspan`.
  * **Mission Gamma (`lecture3.html`):** Teaches project architecture, explaining relative vs. absolute file paths, the importance of HTML boilerplate, and structuring with `<div>`s.
  * **Mission Delta (`lecture4.html`):** Focuses on user interaction by building comprehensive forms with various input types, validation, and data submission concepts.
  * **Mission Epsilon (`lecture5.html`):** Explores multimedia integration with `<audio>`, `<video>`, and embedding external content like YouTube videos.
